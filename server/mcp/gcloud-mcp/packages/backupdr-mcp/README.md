# BackupDR MCP Server ☁️

Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for interacting with Google Cloud Backup and Disaster Recovery.
It enables AI assistants to easily interact with Google Cloud Backup and Disaster Recovery.

With the BackupDR MCP server you can:

- **Interact with Google Cloud BackupDR using natural language.** Describe the
  outcome you want instead of memorizing complex command syntax, flags, and
  arguments.

- **Automate and simplify complex workflows.** Chain multiple operations
  into a single, repeatable command to reduce manual effort and the chance of
  error.

- **Lower the barrier to entry for backup management.** Empower team
  members who are less familiar with GCBDR to perform powerful actions confidently
  and safely.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm):
  version 20 or higher
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (for authentication)

## ✨ Set up your MCP server

### Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist

To integrate the BackupDR MCP server with Gemini CLI or Gemini Code Assist, run the
setup command below. This will install the MCP server as a
[Gemini CLI extension](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/extension.md)
for the current user, making it available for all your projects.

```shell
npx @google-cloud/backupdr-mcp init --agent=gemini-cli --access-level=READ_ONLY --overwrite-context-file=true
```

After the initialization process, you can verify that the backupdr-mcp server is
configured correctly by running the following command:

```
gemini mcp list

> ✓ backupdr (from backupdr-mcp): npx -y backupdr-mcp --access-level READ_ONLY (stdio) - Connected
```

By default, the server only enables read only tools. To enable
tools that can create or update or delete, use the
`--access-level` flag:

```shell
npx @google-cloud/backupdr-mcp init --agent=gemini-cli --access-level=UPSERT --overwrite-context-file=true
```

When access level is UPSERT : create and update tools are made available to agent in addition to the read tools.

```shell
npx @google-cloud/backupdr-mcp init --agent=gemini-cli --access-level=ALL --overwrite-context-file=true
```

When access level is ALL : all tools (including delete) are made available to agent.

By default, the `init` command will NOT overwrite the `GEMINI.md` file in your Gemini CLI extension directory if it already exists (the default value of `--overwrite-context-file` is `false`). This preserves any manual modifications you may have made. To force an overwrite and use the latest version from the package, use the `--overwrite-context-file=true` flag as shown in the examples above.

### For other AI clients

To use the BackupDR MCP server with other clients, add the following snippet to their
respective JSON configuration files:

```json
"backupdr": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/backupdr-mcp"]
}
```

Instructions for popular tools:

- **Claude Desktop:** Open **Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config** and
  edit `claude_desktop_config.json`.
- **Cline:** Click the MCP Servers icon, then **Configure MCP Servers** to edit
  `cline_mcp_settings.json`.
- **Cursor:** Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` for a single project or
  `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for all projects.
- **Gemini CLI (Manual Setup):**
  [If not using extensions](#gemini-cli-and-gemini-code-assist), edit
  `.gemini/settings.json` for a single project or `~/.gemini/settings.json` for
  all projects.

For **Visual Studio Code** edit the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace
for a single project or your global user settings file for all projects:

```json
"servers": {
  "backupdr": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/backupdr-mcp"]
  }
}
```

[development.md](doc/DEVELOPMENT.md)

### Testing

#### Unit Tests

```shell
npm run test
```

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests run against real Google Cloud resources. Ensure you have the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and authenticated.

##### Prerequisites

1.  **Enable APIs**:

    ```shell
    gcloud services enable \
      backupdr.googleapis.com \
      compute.googleapis.com \
      sqladmin.googleapis.com \
      iam.googleapis.com
    ```

2.  **Required Roles**:
    The user or service account running the tests needs the following IAM roles:
    - `roles/backupdr.admin`: To manage BackupDR resources.
    - `roles/compute.admin`: To create and manage test VMs and disks.
    - `roles/cloudsql.admin`: To create and manage test Cloud SQL instances.
    - `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`: To grant necessary permissions to the BackupDR vault service account.

3.  **Run Tests**:
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
    npm run test:integration
    ```

## 🔑 MCP Permissions

The permissions of the BackupDR MCP are directly tied to the permissions of the
authenticated user or service account. To restrict permissions and operate with
the principle of least privilege, you can
[authorize gcloud as a service account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#service-account)
and assign the service account a
[role with limited permissions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview)
for Google Cloud Backup and Disaster Recvery.
